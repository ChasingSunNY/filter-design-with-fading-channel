# filter-design-with-fading-channel
Consider a two-dimensional modulation such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and MPSK, and denote s as the coordinate of the modulated symbol in the complex plane. With this signal model, the receiver’s matched filter output in a frequency nonselective fading channel can be expressed as 
r = hs+n
where h is the signal scaling coefficient due to fading , which is often called the “fading coefficient,” and n is the AWGN term, which follows the complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance N0∕2.
